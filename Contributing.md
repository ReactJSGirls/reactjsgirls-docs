This page isn't fleshed out yet, sorry! Feel free to send PRs to make it better.

In order to build the website you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Git.

Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/ReactJSGirls/reactjsgirls-docs.git
cd reactjsgirls-docs
npm install
```

You can then start the development server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
