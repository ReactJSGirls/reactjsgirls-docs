# Disable Like

We currently have a bug in our app. We can now like the same cat twice, and that shouldn't be allowed. We can fix this by adding a disabled attribute to the button when the cat is already in our favories and attach it to a function that will run every time our render function runs.

To do this with a function like so:

<Code
  code={`
<button
  className="heart-icon"
  disabled={catInFavorites(currentCat)}
  onClick={() => favoriteCat(currentCat)}
>
  <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
</button>
`}
/>

We previously explained why we used an arrow function to call our `favoriteCat` function in a `onClick` event in [Part 6 - Add Cats to Favorites](0.6-add-favorites.mdx#call-the-function), but as you may have noticed, we are not using it for our `catInFavorites` function to disable our button. This is because we want to call this function on page render and every update to make sure that we are disabling the button correctly.

## Writing the function

Now we want to write the logic for disabling the like button for cats that are already in the favorite list. To do this, we have to check if a cat exists in the `favoriteCats` array, and if it does, disable the button. In ES6 we have a new array method to help us do exactly this called [`includes()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes). We use it like this:

<Code
  code={`
  const catInFavorites = cat => favoriteCats.includes(cat)
`}
/>

This function will return false when a cat in our array is not included in our favorites yet and true if it is! This way, our button will be disabled or enabled accordingly! ðŸŽ‰
