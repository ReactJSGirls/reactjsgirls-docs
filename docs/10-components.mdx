# Make Components

Right now all our app works but it's one huge file and that can get out of hand pretty fast so let's split this into several components.

We can split the app in the following parts:

- Header
- Cat image
- Actions
- Favorites

Let's start with the header because that one doesn't need any info from our app.

## Header

Let's create a new folder called `components` and create a new file called `header.js` inside of it.

In it import React and export a function that returns the JSX we had in the header part of our app.

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
  \n
const Header = () => <h1>Choose your favorite cats</h1>
  \n
export default Header
`}
/>

Now we need to import this component in our `index.js` and we can do it by adding this line at the top:

<Code
  code={`
import Header from './components/header'
`}
/>

Instead of the H1 we can now have our new `Header` component like so:

<Code
  code={`
<main>
  <section className="cat-wrapper">
    <Header />
    <section className="cat-container">
      <figure>
        {currentCat ? (
          <img
            key={currentCat}
            className="cat-image"
            src={currentCat}
            alt="A great cat"
          />
        ) : null}
      </figure>
`}
/>

## Favorite Cats

Let's follow the same steps and create a file called `favoriteCats.js` and in it put our code like so:

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
import { GoTrashcan } from 'react-icons/go'
\n
const favoriteCats = () => (
  <ul className="favorite-cats">
    {favoriteCats.map((cat, index) => (
      <li>
        <img class="favorite-cat" src={cat} alt="favorited cat" />
        <button onClick={() => this.removeFavorite(index)}>
          <GoTrashcan size="20" />
        </button>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
\n
export default favoriteCats
`}
/>

In this case our component will need some information from our App component so let's fake that and pass that as parameters to the function favoriteCats.
We need the favoriteCats and also the onclick for when you try to remove a favorite cat so we cant call the function like so:

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
import { GoTrashcan } from 'react-icons/go'
\n
const favoriteCats = ({cats, removeFavorite}) => (
  <ul className="favorite-cats">
    {cats.map((cat, index) => (
      <li>
        <img class="favorite-cat" src={cat} alt="favorited cat" />
        <button onClick={removeFavorite}>
          <GoTrashcan size="20" />
        </button>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
\n
export default favoriteCats
`}
/>

Now we can do the same thing and import/use our function in the `index.js` but it wont work:

<Code
  code={`
import FavoriteCats from './components/favoriteCats'
\n
....
\n
    <FavoriteCats  />
  </section>
</main>
`}
/>

We need to also pass the two values the function on the other side is expecting and we can pass that as we usally pass HTML atributes like so:

<Code
  code={`
import FavoriteCats from './components/favoriteCats'
\n
....
\n
    <FavoriteCats
      cats={favoriteCats}
      removeFavorite={this.removeFavorite}
    />
  </section>
</main>
`}
/>

And now we have our FavoriteCats in a new file and everything looks cleaner.

# Actions

Much like the previous one let's create a new file called `actions.js` and put all the action code there:

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
import { GoHeart, GoArrowRight } from 'react-icons/go'
\n
const Actions = ({ getCat, disabled, favoriteCat }) => (
  <ul className="cat-actions">
    <li>
      <button
        className="heart-icon"
        disabled={this.catInFavorites(currentCat)}
        onClick={() => this.favoriteCat(currentCat)}
      >
        <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
      </button>
    </li>
    <li>
      <button onClick={this.getCat}>
        <GoArrowRight size="30" />
      </button>
    </li>
  </ul>
)
\n
export default Actions
`}
/>

In the same way let's now pass all the component needs to render in our `index.js`

<Code
  code={`
import Actions from './components/actions'
\n
....
\n
<Actions
  getCat={this.getCat}
  disabled={this.catInFavorites(currentCat)}
  favoriteCat={() => this.favoriteCat(currentCat)}
/>
`}
/>

We have now made our `index.js` look way cleaner by moving things into their files and components.
