# Make Components

Right now our app works perfectly fine, but all of our code is in one big file. This can get out of hand pretty fast, so let's split our app's logic into several components.

We can split the app in the following parts:

- Header
- Cat image
- Actions
- Favorites

Let's start with the header because that one doesn't need any info from our app.

## Header

Let's create a new folder called `components` and create a new file called `header.js` inside of it.

In this file, import React and export a function that returns the JSX we had in the header part of our app.

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
  \n
const Header = () => <h1>Choose your favorite cats</h1>
  \n
export default Header
`}
/>

Now we need to import this component in our `index.js` and we can do it by adding this line at the top:

<Code
  code={`
import Header from './components/header'
`}
/>

Instead of the H1 we can now use our new `Header` component like so:

<Code
  code={`
<main>
  <section className="cat-wrapper">
    <Header />
    <section className="cat-container">
      <figure>
        {currentCat ? (
          <img
            key={currentCat}
            className="cat-image"
            src={currentCat}
            alt="A great cat"
          />
        ) : null}
      </figure>
`}
/>

## Favorite Cats

Let's follow the same steps like above and create a file called `favoriteCats.js`. In our new component, we also need to import the icons we want to use. This is how our code will look like:

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
import { GoTrashcan } from 'react-icons/go'
\n
const favoriteCats = () => (
  <ul className="favorite-cats">
    {favoriteCats.map((cat, index) => (
      <li>
        <img class="favorite-cat" src={cat} alt="favorited cat" />
        <button onClick={() => removeFavorite(index)}>
          <GoTrashcan size="20" />
        </button>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
\n
export default favoriteCats
`}
/>

Our new component will also need some information from our App component, so we need to change a few things. To make this new component accept data from our parent component, we add `{ cats, removeFavorite }` like so: 

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
import { GoTrashcan } from 'react-icons/go'
\n
const favoriteCats = ({ cats, removeFavorite }) => (
  <ul className="favorite-cats">
    {cats.map((cat, index) => (
      <li>
        <img class="favorite-cat" src={cat} alt="favorited cat" />
        <button onClick={() => removeFavorite(index)}>
          <GoTrashcan size="20" />
        </button>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
\n
export default favoriteCats
`}
/>

Instead of our list getting data from `favoriteCats`, we now want to get it from `cats`, which we will pass down from our App component in the next step. This means we have to change `favoriteCats.map(...)` to `cats.map(...)`, but we can leave `removeFavorite(index)` as it is, because the name hasn't changed.

As you might have noticed, our code is now broken with the new changes we made to the code. We also need to update our App component to make sure our app works again. Now we can do the same thing and import/use our function in the `index.js`. However it still won't work:

<Code
  code={`
import FavoriteCats from './components/favoriteCats'
\n
....
\n
    <FavoriteCats  />
  </section>
</main>
`}
/>

We also need to pass the two values the function in our new component is expecting, which are `cats` and `removeFavorite`. We do this the way we write HTML atributes:

<Code
  code={`
import FavoriteCats from './components/favoriteCats'
\n
....
\n
    <FavoriteCats
      cats={favoriteCats}
      removeFavorite={removeFavorite}
    />
  </section>
</main>
`}
/>

And now we have our FavoriteCats in a new file and everything looks cleaner.

# Actions

Much like the previous one let's create a new file called `actions.js` and put all the action code there:

<Code
  code={`
import React from 'react'
import { GoHeart, GoArrowRight } from 'react-icons/go'
\n
const Actions = ({ getCat, disabled, favoriteCat }) => (
  <ul className="cat-actions">
    <li>
      <button
        className="heart-icon"
        disabled={disabled}
        onClick={favoriteCat}
      >
        <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
      </button>
    </li>
    <li>
      <button onClick={getCat}>
        <GoArrowRight size="30" />
      </button>
    </li>
  </ul>
)
\n
export default Actions
`}
/>

In the same way let's now pass all the data this component needs to render in our `index.js`

<Code
  code={`
import Actions from './components/actions'
\n
....
\n
<Actions
  getCat={getCat}
  disabled={catInFavorites(currentCat)}
  favoriteCat={() => favoriteCat(currentCat)}
/>
`}
/>

We have now made our `index.js` look way cleaner by moving things into separate files and components.
