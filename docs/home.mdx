# About ReactJS Girls Workshops

ReactJS Girls is an initiative created and carried out by the React Community to encourage more people to learn React. ReactJS Girls mission is to create workshops to teach React in a cool and fun way to people who come from underrepresented groups in tech. It is based on the successful model pioneered by Jen Looper for the Vue community, [Vue Vixens](https://vuevixens.org).

These workshops are designed to help people get better acquainted with React.

## FAQ

**Do I need a computer?**

Yes.

**Do I need to set up a local enviroment?**

No. Everything we code will be on [codesanbox.io](https://codesanbox.io) so all you need is a computer with internet access.
I will probably even run thbe workshops in a ChromeBook.

**Where can I register for a Workshop?**

Workshop attendees and mentors can register for events at [reactjsgirls.com](https://www.reactjsgirls.com). Keep an eye on our Twitter feed [@reactjsgirls](https://mobile.twitter.com/reactjsgirls) for announcements of upcoming events. ReactJS Girls workshops are free, but depend on budget from conferences and meetups to provide lunch, breakfast, or snacks, and a space with wifi.

**Why is it called ReactJSGirls if people from other underrepresented groups can participate?**

The brand for ReactJSGirls was already set up from meetups in Berlin and London so we thought that as a first step it would be better to keep the name and then change it as it grows maybe. We are always open to name suggestions.

**I'm not a part of an underrepresented group. Can I participate?**

The goal of the program is to support underrepresented people in the community so unfortunatly you cannot attend the workshop as an attendee but we are always looking for mentors.

**Do initiatives like this exist for other frameworks?**

Yes ðŸŽ‰

There is [Vue Vixens](https://vuevixens.org) for Vue and [ngGirls](http://ng-girls.org/) for Angular.
