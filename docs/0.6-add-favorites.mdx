# Add Cats to favorites

The next step is to make it possible to click on the heart icon and add a cat to our favorite list. To do this, we will have an array in our state that we will store all our favorite cats. When a button with a heart icon is clicked, we concat the cat data on this array to store it as a favorite.

Let's start with adding our base state:

<Code
  code={`
  const [favoriteCats, setFavoriteCats] = useState([])
`}
/>

## Create the add favorite function

If we think about the state of our app, we know that we have an empty array where all our favorite cats will be stored. In order to add the cat we just liked to our `favoriteCats` array, we need to concat the new cat.

Our function looks like:

<Code
  code={`
  const favoriteCat = cat => {
    setFavoriteCats(favoriteCats.concat(cat))
  }
`}
/>

This function gets a cat and with it adds it to the array so that later we can map all over the cats we have saved in that array.

## Call the function

In our JSX we have a `button` with a heart icon inside. We will attach an `onClick` event to it and use it to pass the cat we are seeing to our `favouriteCats` array.

<Code
  code={`
<button
  onClick={() => favoriteCat(currentCat)}
  className="heart-icon"
>
  <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
</button>
`}
/>

The reason our function looks like this: `() => favoriteCat(currentCat)` instead of `favoriteCat(currentCat)`, is because the latter would call the function on the component, when we only want it called on the click of the button.

## Add the JSX

Let's now add the necessary JSX to make it possible for us to show our favorite cats right after we close the `cat-container` section:

<Code
  code={`
<ul className="favorite-cats">
  {favoriteCats.map(cat => (
    <li>
      <img class="favorite-cat" src={cat} alt="favorited cat" />
      <button>
        <GoTrashcan size="20" />
      </button>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
`}
/>

Here we are getting the `favoriteCats` array and mapping over each cat in the array and it's URL.
For each cat, we create a list item and place an image inside of it, along with a button that will serve the purpose of deleting the cat from the favorites list.
