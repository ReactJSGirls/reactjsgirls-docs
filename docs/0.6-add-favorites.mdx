# Add Cats to favorites

Next step is to able to click the heart icon and add a cat to our favorite list and to do this we will have an array in our state that we will push to when someone clicks the heart button on a cat.

Let's start with adding our base state:

<Code
  code={`
state = {
  currentCat: null,
  favoriteCats: []
};
`}
/>

## Create the add favorite function

If we think about the state of our app we know that we have an empty array where we are supposed to put our favorite cats so we need to concat the cat we just liked.

Our function looks like:

<Code
  code={`
favoriteCat = cat => {
  this.setState(state => ({
    favoriteCats: state.favoriteCats.concat(cat)
  }));
};
`}
/>

You may notice that we are using setState in a different way then we did in the past.
That's because we can use it as a function that receives the state as an argument and this is useful when we want to modify the state based on the one we have and in this case we want to add something to an array so we need the previous state.

So, this function gets a cat and with it adds it to the array so that later we can map all over the cats we have saved in that array.

## Call the function

In our JSX we have a `button` that is used for the heart icon and we want to attach it this function to it and also we need to pass it the current cat we are seeing.

<Code
  code={`
<button
  onClick={() => this.favoriteCat(this.state.currentCat)}
  className="heart-icon"
>
  <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
</button>
`}
/>

The reason we call it like: `() => this.favoriteCat(this.state.currentCat)` instead of just doing `this.favoriteCat(this.state.currentCat)` is because calling like this would call the function on the component mount and we only want to call it on click.

## Add the JSX

Let's now add the necessary JSX to make it possible for us to show our favorite cats right after we close the `cat-container` section:

<Code
  code={`
<ul className="favorite-cats">
  {this.state.favoriteCats.map(cat => (
    <li>
      <img class="favorite-cat" src={cat} alt="favorited cat" />
      <button>
        <GoTrashcan size="20" />
      </button>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
`}
/>

What we are doing here is getting the favoriteCats and mapping over each cat in the array and it's url.
For each we create a list item and in it place an image and a button that will serve the propose of deleting the cat from the favorites.
