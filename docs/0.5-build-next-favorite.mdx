# Build the Next and Favorite UI

## Install `react-icons`

First thing we will need to do is install [`react-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons). On CodeSandbox you do this by clicking `Add Dependency`, and searching for and clicking `react-icons`. Now CodeSandbox will automatically install it in your project.

After this we want to indicate which icons we want to use: `GoHeart` and `GoArrowRight`. We have to import them from `/go`, so we write:

<Code
  code={`
import { GoHeart, GoArrowRight } from "react-icons/go";
`}
/>

## Add the boilerplate JSX

Now it's time to add our JSX so that we can show our buttons, but they won't actually do anything yet. After the `<figure>` tag paste this JSX:

<Code
  code={`
<ul className="cat-actions">
  <li>
    <button className="heart-icon">
      <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
    </button>
  </li>
  <li>
    <button>
      <GoArrowRight size="30" />
    </button>
  </li>
</ul>
`}
/>

## Add next cat functionality

Now that we have added the JSX above, we want add the functionality to get a new cat when we click the next button. To do this we use the event handler called `onClick`, and attach it to the button and call a function inside of it.

> We are attaching it to the button and not the actual icon because of accessability concerns. If someone with an assisting technology device tries to access our website and the onClick is on the icon, it will not be announced as a button.

We already have the `getCat` function that we can use to get a new cat, so we need to attach it on the button:

<Code
  code={`
<ul className="cat-actions">
  <li>
    <button className="heart-icon">
      <GoHeart size="30" color="#f44336" />
    </button>
  </li>
  <li>
    <button onClick={getCat}>
      <GoArrowRight size="30" />
    </button>
  </li>
</ul>
`}
/>

When you now click on the next button, you will get a new cat! ðŸŽ‰
