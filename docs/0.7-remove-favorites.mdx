# Remove Cats from favorites

We can now add favorite cats in our app, but when want to delete a cat from favorites, nothing happens. In this section we will create a function to do this.

First step is to think about how we want to do this:

We currently have all of our cat image URLs in an array, and we want to remove the one that belongs to the `li` that is being clicked. Which means, all cats should stay in our array unless the URL from the click matches a cat in the array.

To implement this functionality, we create a filter function where we take all the cats in the `favoriteCats` array and only return the cats with a URL that is different from the URL of the cat we want to delete, like so:

<Code
  code={`
  const removeFavorite = currentCat => {
    setFavoriteCats(favoriteCats.filter(cat => cat !== currentCat))
  }
`}
/>

This filter function returns a new array with all the elements that pass our test: if `cat` don't match our `currentCat` URL, return `cat`. In our case, this will be all the cats except for the one we clicked on to delete.

To make this work in our app, we have to pass the URL of the cat we are clicking on as a parameter to our function, which in this case is `cat`.

<Code
  code={`
  <button onClick={() => removeFavorite(cat)}>
    <GoTrashcan size="20" />
  </button>
`}
/>

If you now click on the trash can icon to delete a cat from the favorites list, you can see that it gets deleted! ðŸŽ‰
